1. Give Liker bot an admin permission to edit posts in your channel.

2. If you have a discussion group (e.g. post comments) ‚Äî add Liker to the group also.

3. In order to customize reactions (üëç is a default reaction) send the following command to Liker in Telegram:
```
/set_reactions ‚Äîchannel_id [YOUR_CHANNEL_ID] ‚Äîreactions [SPACE_SEPARATED_REACTIONS]
```
For example:
```
/set_reactions ‚Äîchannel_id @awesome_channel ‚Äîreactions üëç ‚ù§ üò°
```
